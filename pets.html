                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                <p>Fitz loves chasing tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. He is often found sitting by the fire in wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He is very energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap to sit on for too long.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">Fitz loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats, and whines when he comes inside and does not get a snack.</p>

                <img src="images/van_gogh_on_fridge.jpg" width = "400" alt="Ragdoll cat sitting on top of black fridge">
                <p>Van Gogh is a three year old cat of mixed ragdoll and domestic shorthair breed. He was adopted when he was 7 months old. Van Gogh has been a "people cat" since he was young. He craves attention but needs alone time when he wants it. He is a pure masterpiece, staring with his sapphire eyes at his human friends. He loves birds, rats, insects, and water from a human mug.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">Van Gogh is responsible for his household's safety. But he gets scared when the vacuum machine wakes up. He tries his best to put up a good defense, but his beautiful fur coat gets messed up immediately when he gets too close. He likes to brush his fur coat himself, and can bite when others try to fix it for him.</p>
